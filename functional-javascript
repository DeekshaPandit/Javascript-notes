Higher order functions: 

  In Javascript, functions can be assigned to variables in the same way that strings or arrays can. They can be passed into other functions as parameters or returned from them as well.
  A “higher-order function” is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.
  
 Functions are called as First class objects.
 They can co-exist with and can be treated like any other javascript object
 1) assigned to variables and properties of other objects.
 2) passed as arguments into functions
 3) returned as values from functions
 
     obj = {a:1, b:2}
     obj = function() {
              return {a:1}
          }
